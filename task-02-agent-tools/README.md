#### ðŸ§© **Task 2 â€” Chatbot with Conversation Summary Memory**

##### **1. Description**

This task builds upon Task 1 by adding a **summary-based memory** to the chatbot.
Instead of storing the full chat history, the system keeps a **short summary** of previous interactions.
This helps maintain context while using **less memory**, making it suitable for **long conversations**.

##### **2. Logic**

1. **User sends a message.**
2. **Memory retrieves a summarized version** of the past conversation.
3. **LLM uses this summary + new input** to generate a contextual response.
4. **Memory updates automatically** by summarizing the new exchange and storing it.

##### **3. Flow Diagram**

##### **4. Memory Type Used**

* **ConversationSummaryMemory**

  * Uses an LLM to **summarize previous dialogue** after each turn.
  * Keeps the essential context while discarding unnecessary details.
  * Ideal for **long-running chat sessions** or **resource-limited systems**.
  * Example:

    ```python
    from langchain.memory import ConversationSummaryMemory
    memory = ConversationSummaryMemory(llm=chat_model)
    ```
  * The summary is stored and refreshed automatically as the conversation continues.

##### **5. Example Behavior**

```
User: Hello! Yesterday we talked about AI projects.
Bot: Yes, I remember youâ€™re working on an AI project. Howâ€™s it going today?

User: Itâ€™s going great, I added a recommendation system.
Bot: Thatâ€™s awesome! What type of recommendations are you building?
```

##### **6. Key Takeaway**

This chatbot demonstrates how to maintain **long-term conversational context** efficiently using **ConversationSummaryMemory**, which balances **context retention** and **performance**.
