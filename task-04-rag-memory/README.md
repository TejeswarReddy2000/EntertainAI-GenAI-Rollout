#### ðŸ§© **Task 4 â€” Chatbot with Vector Store Memory (Knowledge-Based Chatbot)**

##### **1. Description**

This task builds an **AI chatbot with external knowledge** using **Vector Store Memory**.
Unlike earlier tasks where the chatbot only remembered conversation history,
this one can **store and retrieve factual information** from documents or databases.

It uses **embeddings** (numerical representations of text) to search and recall relevant knowledge when answering user queries.

---

##### **2. Logic**

1. **Data Preparation:**
   The system loads text data (like PDFs, notes, or docs).

2. **Embedding Creation:**
   Each piece of text is converted into **vector embeddings** using a model like `OpenAIEmbeddings` or `GoogleEmbeddings`.

3. **Storage in Vector Database:**
   These embeddings are saved in a **Vector Store** (e.g., FAISS, Chroma).

4. **User Query:**
   When the user asks a question, the system converts the query into an embedding and **searches for the most similar vectors** (relevant information).

5. **Response Generation:**
   The retrieved data is combined with the query and passed to the **LLM**, which generates a factual, context-aware answer.

##### **4. Memory Type Used**

* **Vector Store Memory**

  * Stores **long-term knowledge** in vector form.
  * Supports **semantic search**, meaning it understands the *meaning* of text rather than just matching keywords.
  * Common Libraries: `FAISS`, `Chroma`, or `Pinecone`.

  Example:

  ```python
  from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS
  from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
  from langchain.memory import VectorStoreRetrieverMemory

  embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
  vectorstore = FAISS.from_texts(["AI is the simulation of human intelligence"], embeddings)
  retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever()
  memory = VectorStoreRetrieverMemory(retriever=retriever)
  ```

---

##### **5. Example Behavior**

```
User: What is Artificial Intelligence?
Bot: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines.

User: Who invented AI?
Bot: The concept of AI was first introduced by John McCarthy in 1956 at the Dartmouth Conference.
```

##### **6. Key Takeaway**

This chatbot demonstrates **knowledge-based retrieval** using **Vector Store Memory**,
allowing it to **recall factual information** from stored documents and generate more **accurate, data-driven answers**.

Would you like me to write the `README.md` for **Task 5** next (which usually involves combining vector memory with conversational memory for hybrid chat)?
